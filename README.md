## Overview

This project involves analyzing real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. The dataset used is a subset of a larger dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. The goal of this project is to calculate summary statistics, draw inferences from the statistics, calculate business metrics, and use models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies.

  

The project consists of three main tasks:

  

1. Data Analysis and Presentation: Conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings. Identify a question about the data that you will answer based on your analysis, including at least one categorical variable and one quantitative variable. Use summary statistics to support your answer and include visualizations in your presentation.
2. Profit and Loss Statement Dashboard: Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement. The dashboard should calculate Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. It should include historical data for all available years.
3. Financial Forecasting Model: Create a financial model for a different company of your choice. The model should forecast Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case). Each scenario should have different assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin.

  

The project requires the use of Excel or Google Sheets functions, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret measures of central tendency and spread. Visualizations and communication skills are also important for presenting the results effectively.

  

The deliverables for this project include a slide presentation with visualizations and summary information, a spreadsheet with summary statistics, a dynamic Profit and Loss Statement dashboard, and a forecasting model spreadsheet.

  

## Business Problem/Business Task

  

Develop a comprehensive financial analysis and forecasting solution for S&P 500 companies using historical data from the New York Stock Exchange. The solution should include creation of a business question for a data analysis, presentation of findings, creation of a Profit and Loss Statement dashboard, and development of a financial forecasting model.

  

Business Question: What GICS Sector had the most significant changes in Gross Profit between 2013 and 2016?

## Goals

By the end of the project I will achieve the goal of demonstrating proficiency in Excel or Google Sheets functions, analyzing and interpreting measures of central tendency and spread, and effectively presenting the results through strong visualization and communication skills. The deliverables for this project will include a slide presentation with visualizations, summary information, and key insights, a spreadsheet with summary statistics derived from the dataset, a dynamic Profit and Loss Statement dashboard, and a financial forecasting model spreadsheet that predicts future financial performance based on different scenarios.

## Scope

1. Data Analysis and Presentation:
    *   Analyze the provided dataset to identify key insights and trends.
    *   Create a presentation summarizing the findings, including visualizations and supporting statistics.
    *   Answer a specific question about the data using both categorical and quantitative variables.
2. Profit and Loss Statement Dashboard:
    *   Develop a dynamic dashboard that calculates Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a selected company.
    *   Include historical data for all available years to provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance.
3. Financial Forecasting Model:
    *   Create a financial model for a different company of your choice.
    *   Forecast Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for the next two years using three scenarios: Best case, Weak case, and Base case.
    *   Incorporate different assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin in each scenario.

## Deliverables

*   Slide presentation with visualizations, summary information, and key insights from the data analysis.
*   Spreadsheet with summary statistics derived from the dataset.
*   Dynamic Profit and Loss Statement dashboard that calculates financial metrics for a selected company.
*   Financial forecasting model spreadsheet that predicts future financial performance based on different scenarios.

## Data Preprocessing

Steps taken to preprocess data

*       *   Create a duplicate of the raw data
    *   Renamed the duplicate sheet
    *   Used the insert table feature to transform the existing information into a table
    *   Identify the missing values
    *   Ensure that all data is in a common and consistent format.
    *   Create a data dictionary for name ranges
    *   Create required sheets
    *   Create a workflow for data manipulation
    *   Create plan to shape model, pivot tables, and profit/loss sheet
    *   Identify metrics to use for analysis
    *   Choose interactive feature

  

## Scope Analysis

*   The Energy GICS Sector seems to have the most significant change between the years 2013 – 2016.
*   The mean or average gross profit of the Energy GICS Sector is 11,354,284,080.65. So, on average, out of the 31 companies of the energy sector in this dataset have a gross profit around this value.
*   The median of the gross profit this Energy Sector is 4,185,022,500.00 which is significantly lower than the mean. This suggests that the dataset may have some extreme high values that are pulling the mean up.
*   The standard deviation of the gross profit of the Energy Sector is23,792,869,627.79 which indicates a significant spread or variability in the gross profit values. Some companies have much higher or lower gross profits than the mean, contributing to this variability.
*   The range of the gross profits for the Energy Sector is  149,585,000,000.00 shows the difference between the highest and lowest gross profit values in the dataset. This highlights the wide variability in profitability among the companies.

  

## Insight and Findings

*   The Energy GICS Sector witnessed significant transformations during the span from 2013 to 2016. These changes were predominantly linked to fluctuations in oil prices, geopolitical shifts, technological advancements, and alterations in energy policies, resulting in a substantial plunge in gross profit margins.
*   Marked by an astonishing 40% drop in total revenue, the period between 2013 and 2016 also saw gross revenue dwindle from its peak of $13.349 billion to a mere $4.318 billion, creating a notable variance of $9.031 billion between the initial year (2013) and the fourth year (2016).
*   A probable influence on these severe disparities lies in the drastic escalation of overall operating expenses, peaking at $30.163 billion when revenue hit its all-time low of $6.383 billion in 2016, as contrasted with the $16.428 billion recorded in the first year.
